# Generalists

**Overhead and coordination agents that keep the fleet operational.**

Generalists handle the meta-work: orchestrating tasks, triaging incoming work, managing context, and resolving conflicts between specialists. They don't produce domain-specific deliverables — they make it possible for specialists to produce theirs.

## What Makes a Generalist

Generalists share these traits:

1. **System-level view.** They hold the full fleet context — who is working on what, what's blocked, what's next. They see the forest, not the trees.

2. **Routing authority.** They decide where work goes. Specialists do the work; generalists decide who does it and in what order.

3. **No domain execution.** A generalist never writes code, designs a schema, audits security, or produces any specialist deliverable. The moment it starts doing specialist work, it has drifted out of its role.

4. **Escalation receiver.** Generalists are the first line for escalations from specialists. They either resolve the issue (rerouting, decomposition, priority changes) or pass it up to the Admiral.

## Generalist Roster

| Agent | Purpose | Defined In |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestrator** | Decomposes goals into tasks, routes to specialists, manages progress, enforces standards | [`agents/command/orchestrator.md`](agents/command/orchestrator.md) |
| **Triage Agent** | Classifies incoming work by type, priority, and complexity; routes to the Orchestrator | [`agents/command/triage-agent.md`](agents/command/triage-agent.md) |
| **Context Curator** | Assembles context payloads for agents; manages what each agent knows and when | [`agents/command/context-curator.md`](agents/command/context-curator.md) |
| **Mediator** | Resolves conflicting outputs between specialists; synthesizes divergent approaches | [`agents/command/mediator.md`](agents/command/mediator.md) |

## How Generalists Interact

```

- **Triage Agent** receives raw work and classifies it → passes to **Orchestrator**
- **Orchestrator** decomposes and routes → assigns to **Specialists**
- **Context Curator** prepares context payloads → feeds to any agent before session start
- **Mediator** resolves conflicts → feeds resolution back to **Orchestrator** for routing

All generalist output ultimately flows toward specialist task assignment or Admiral escalation.
